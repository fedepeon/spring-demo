= SpringDemo API v{version}

This **RESTful API** provides a easy way to manage the users in this
system, using the standard methods of the **HTTP** protocol.

Here I explain how to manage this resource, with a **cURL** example of the request
and the raw **HTTP** requests.

== Create New Users
To create some new users, send a **HTTP POST** to `{path}`, with
the _User_ as a json-encoded object in the request body.
It should response with a **JSON** object that represents the created user.

=== Response Fields

include::{snippets}/user-create/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Example

include::{snippets}/user-create/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/user-create/http-response.adoc[]

== List and Search Users
To list all the users, send a **HTTP GET** to `{path}`.
It should response with a *JSON* array that contains all the results.

=== Request Parameters

include::{snippets}/user-search/request-parameters.adoc[]

=== Basic Example
Without the `query` parameter, it will response with all the users.

=== Search Example
The `query` parameter is used as a _regular expression_ filter against the user's
firstname and lastname.
